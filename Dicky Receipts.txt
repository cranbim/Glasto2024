•	You need mental health, you need vitality, you need rest, relaxation and human contact. You can have these things no matter what your face looks like, however you choose to move through the world. You can have these things on your own terms. You know your body better than any advert. You decide what you need and when. Tell them, don’t let them tell you. 
•	The things you choose to keep you well and healthy have come further than Boots, further than Holland & Barrett, further than your yoga studio. They have come from more than one person, more than one generation, more than one mind. You are the latest in a long line of people to look after themselves in this way. Honor them and honor yourself.
•	120 billion units of plastic packaging come from the personal care & beauty industry each year. This contributes to waste, water pollution and marine life endangerment. Now we’re not going to hold a turtle up to your face and make you confess your sins or anything, but maybe just have a think. 
•	Never believe your wellness is dependent on your wallet. Don’t be told you can’t afford to be well. Those who can’t afford your shampoo are not less healthy than you. There is no correlation between wealth and health. 
•	We apologise, previous adverts may have been misleading. Buying our shaving foam will not provide a better relationship with your father. Research has shown fathers do not care about the relative smoothness their son’s face. No refund will be given at this time, research has shown you didn’t need our product anyway. 
•	We apologise, previous adverts may have been misleading. The young man shown in our advert did not win the girl by simply putting on deodorant. The woman in question did not change her mind about him because he smelt differently. Research has shown young men are more than just their scent. No refund will be issued at this time. Research has shown you didn’t need our product anyway. 
•	We apologise, previous adverts may have been misleading. Our universal foundation was not in fact “for all skin types”, nor was it for all skin tones. Research has shown that you are individuals, not one large amalgam of woman. No refund will be issued at this time. Research has shown you didn’t need our product anyway. 
•	We apologise, previous adverts may have been misleading. “Cruelty free” only applies to cruelty to animals. We will continue to bully and coerce you into buying our products and openly mistreat the planet. No refund will be issued at this time. Research has shown you didn’t need our product anyway. 
•	We apologise, previous adverts may have been misleading. It has been brought to our attention that “Chemical Free!” is an impossibility. Water is in fact a chemical. No refund will be issued at this time. Research has shown you didn’t need our product anyway. 
•	Listen to yourself about your body. Don’t be “influenced” by people who don’t know your body, don’t know your medical history, don’t know who you are and what you need. Do listen to doctors, obviously. They know what riboflavin is!
